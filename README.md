# HireEase

The project’s idea is to develop a platform for enterprises
and aggregated all recruiters/agencies for maintaining profiles of candidates, processing
their resumes uploaded using NLP, scheduling recruitment processes and
providing feedback back to enterprises. The various intermediate outcomes expected
to be achieved include: Dashboard for Enterprises and Recruiters Job Posting by
Enterprises and Broadcast the Job requirements to all recruiters instantly as per recruiters’
functional areas Aggregate all recruiters/agencies for job requirement Process
all incoming Profiles (Word, PDF, TXT) uploaded by Recruiters using NLP
. NLP Processor will first preprocess the documents received and then the preprocessed
text will be tokenized using NLP and sent to the trained model which will
provide the job position relating and the most matching to that resume, this result
would further be mapped to the job requirement posted by the enterprises. This
shortlists candidates with matching requirements.
